# bubble-sort-visualization
Bubble Sort Algorithm step by step visualization using Python and the Pygame module.

This project shows how Bubble Sort Algorithm works with a set of given dataset (array) 
and sort the dataset by clicking the "Sort" button to see how each pair of the dataset
moves its location based on the smaller and larger values in the array.

This project has given me a clearer visualization of how Bubble Sort works in action
and is a great way to interact with the Pygamme module to create a fun, interactive projects.
